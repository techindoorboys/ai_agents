I would like to build a web browsing ai agent.
I would like to have following tools used for simplicity

1. Python
2. UV for package manager
3. LangGraph for agent orchestration
4. dotenv for managing the environment
5. streamlit for a simple ui
6. fastapi for the backend
7. For getting web page information, lets use free tools such as beautifulsoup

Provide me code to create the above project from starting to end
Additional Note: I am going to do this in github codespaces, hence how to run these backend and frontend, please instruct me that.
