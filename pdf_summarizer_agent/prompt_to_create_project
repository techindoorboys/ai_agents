I would like to build a Build a PDF Summarizer Agent that extracts insights
I would like to have following tools used for simplicity

1. Python
2. UV for package manager
3. LangGraph for agent orchestration
4. dotenv for managing the environment
5. streamlit for a simple ui
6. fastapi for the backend
7. For getting web page information, lets use free tools such as beautifulsoup

Provide me code to create the above project from starting to end
Additional Note: I am going to do this in github codespaces, hence how to run these backend and frontend, please instruct me that.

Additional Notes
* use latest genai libraries 
* Given a pdf of the url, it should generate very nice insights like summary, abstract and etc.
* I want to implement using LLM/Gemini only from the beginning but simple
