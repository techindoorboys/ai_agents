I would like to build a Build a Research Assistant that Generates Citation

I would like to have following tools used for simplicity

1. Python
2. UV for package manager
3. LangGraph for agent orchestration
4. dotenv for managing the environment
5. streamlit for a simple ui
6. fastapi for the backend
7. For searching you can use duckduckgo


Provide me code to create the above project from starting to end
Additional Note: I am going to do this in github codespaces, hence how to run these backend and frontend, please instruct me that.

Additional Notes
* use latest genai libraries and not google generative ai
* Given a pdf of the url, it should generate very nice insights like summary, abstract and etc.
* I want to implement using LLM/Gemini only from the beginning but simple
